Accepted

## Context

The billing boundary within our software system is essential for managing financial transactions, ensuring a secure and 
efficient payment process for our users. This boundary encompasses all aspects of financial interactions in the application, 
including the integration with payment gateways, processors, and e-wallets to facilitate online transactions. 
The services within this boundary are responsible for handling customer checkouts, invoicing, processing payments, 
and managing recurring payments for subscriptions. 

Effective operation within this boundary is crucial for providing a smooth and user-friendly payment experience, 
maintaining trust, and ensuring the financial stability of the service.

## Decision

We have established the billing boundary with the following specialized services to cater 
to the diverse aspects of billing and financial transactions:

+ **Billing Service:** Acts as the core of the billing system, handling invoicing, payment processing, 
  and the integration with external payment gateways and processors. It is responsible for executing transactions securely 
  and efficiently, using Go as its primary programming language.
+ **Wallet Service:** Manages e-wallet operations, including storing, updating, and querying user balance information. 
  It supports transactions within the system, including credits and debits to user accounts. 
  Developed in Go with Solidity for blockchain-based operations, it ensures a secure and decentralized approach 
  to financial management within the system.

Each service is carefully designed to focus on specific functionalities within the billing boundary, ensuring clarity, 
efficiency, and security in handling financial transactions. Documentation is provided for each service 
to facilitate understanding and further development.

## Consequences

This dedicated approach to managing the billing boundary enhances the system's ability to handle financial 
transactions securely and efficiently. By modularizing billing functionalities into distinct services, 
we improve the system's scalability, maintainability, and performance.  

However, this specialization requires ongoing attention to security, compliance with financial regulations, 
and integration with multiple payment systems, which may increase complexity and the need 
for specialized knowledge in financial technology.
